	<description>Allows you to build, mine, zone, etc. in various shapes. First select the task you want to do (build, mine, zone), then go into the shapes menu and select the shape. Use the rotate keys to rotate the shape. There are settings you can adjust for flood-fill, location of the shapes menu, and whether the menu pops up when selecting a task.
